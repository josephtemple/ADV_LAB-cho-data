This repository serves the partial purpose of ''data and analysis'' sections of the lab notebook for the Coupled Harmonic Oscillator lab of PHYS 4113. 
The bulk of the ''information'' is found in the iPython notebook, but all the raw, cleaned, and Fourier transformed data is included in the repo, as well
as every generated plot.
